        "content":"Qantas will axe 6,000 jobs as part of its plans to survive the coronavirus pandemic, the airline says.\n\nThe cuts equate to about a fifth of the airline's workforce prior to the Covid-19 crisis. In March, it furloughed more than 80% of its staff.\n\nAustralia's national carrier said the collapse in global air travel had devastated revenues.\n\nLast week, the Australian government said its border would most likely remain closed into next year.\n\nIt prompted Qantas to cancel all international flights until late October, except for those to New Zealand.\n\nOn Thursday, chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline expected smaller revenues in the next three years, forcing it to become a smaller operation to survive.\n\n\"The actions we must take will have a huge impact on thousands of our people,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"But the collapse in billions of dollars in revenue leaves us little choice if we are to save as many jobs as possible, long term.\"",

Gen. Xavier Becerra, backed by city attorneys in San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, on Wednesday filed a request for a preliminary injunction in their lawsuit against the gig companies.\n\nIf granted, it would mean the companies must reclassify their workers in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe motion will be discussed at a hearing set for Aug. 6.\n\nThe request came as about 50 Uber drivers in San Francisco blocked the street outside the home of the company‚Äôs chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, demanding employee benefits and better provisions for protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, the actress' old photos reappeared on Tuesday, when she and rumored boyfriend Timoth√©e Chalamet were pictured vacationing in Mexico amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nThe 30-year-old has previously apologized for the offensive images, but in a statement to E! News shared Wednesday she reiterated, \"I am deeply sorry and ashamed about having worn blackface makeup shown in the images circulating. As a 15-year-old child actor on my first job in a Mexican telenovela, I was pressured against my will, and with no negotiating power, I could not advocate for myself in the situation. I wish I had the voice and knowledge then that I have now.\"\n\nEiza is just one of the handful of public figures who are apologizing for photos of themselves dressed in blackface.",

        "source":"KnowTechie",
        "content":"Growing up, the two-wheeled, self-balancing Segway was iconic. It really did feel like the future. Now, 19 years after its initial release, Segway is ending production of the motorized vehicle, according to a new report from Fast Company.\n\nFirst released in 2001, the Segway made waves as the future of transportation, with Steve Jobs even saying that it could be as big as the PC. That said, it never made the splash it was expected to. Instead, it was relegated to the ranks of Segway city tours, with adoption numbers never reaching critical mass. To date, the company has sold approximately 140,000 units. Fast Company notes that initially, Segway hoped to sell 100,000 units in the first 13 months.\n\nHindsight is 20/20, of course, but Segway‚Äôs shape definitely played a role in low adoption numbers. Unlike today‚Äôs electric scooters, which can easily be stored, Segway‚Äôs were bulky, making them more of a novelty than a true means of transportation for crowded cities. That said, the two-wheeled machines definitely helped bring other self-balancing and electric transportation methods into the limelight.\n\nAccording to Fast Company, the manufacturing facility in Bedford, Newe Hampshire will stop production on July 15. 21 employees will be laid off, with another 12 people staying on temporarily to handle warranties, repairs, and more. The five employees currently working on the company‚Äôs Discovery scooters will continue to work.",
